# Partners Module Implementation

## Overview
The Partners module has been successfully implemented with full CRUD functionality and dynamic public page display. The module allows administrators to manage partners through an admin interface, and displays active partners on the public website.

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: REAL PARTNERS DATA IMPLEMENTED**

The partners module now contains the **real partners data** from the official Jariah Fund website at [https://jariahfund.muamalat.com.my/rakan-amal/](https://jariahfund.muamalat.com.my/rakan-amal/).

### Real Partners Added:
1. **Yayasan Muslimin** - Islamic foundation focusing on waqf, sedekah, and zakat
